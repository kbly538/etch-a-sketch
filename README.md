# Etch-a-Sketch Project

Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch project! This is a simple web-based drawing application that allows you to create artwork on a 16x16 grid. You can paint with different colors, erase, apply grayscale, or even use a rainbow mode. Let's explore how to use and customize the Etch-a-Sketch.

## Features

### Grid Size

You can customize the grid size using the size selector. The default grid size is 16x16, but you can choose from various sizes up to a maximum of 100x100.

### Drawing Modes

- **Default Mode:** Click to paint cells with the selected color.
- **Grayscale Mode:** Paint cells with a grayscale effect.
- **Rainbow Mode:** Paint cells with random rainbow colors.
- **Erasing Mode:** Erase cell colors.

### Color Picker

Select your desired color using the color picker. This color will be used for painting in the default and grayscale modes.

### Eraser

Toggle the eraser mode on and off using the eraser checkbox. When activated, painting cells will erase their colors.

### Clear Button

Click the "Clear" button to reset the grid and start fresh with the default settings.

## How to Use

- **Single Click:** Paint a cell with the selected color.
- **Click and Drag:** Paint multiple cells while dragging the mouse.
- **Eraser Mode:** Toggle the eraser mode and click to erase cell colors.

## Code Structure

The JavaScript file (`etch-a-sketch.js`) contains the logic for setting up the grid, handling user interactions, and implementing various drawing modes.
